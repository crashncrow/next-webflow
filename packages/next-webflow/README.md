# next-webflow

Use the Webflow CMS as a headless content source in Next.js (App Router): generated types, caching, on-demand revalidation via webhooks, draft previews, and rendering components.

> **Work in progress.** Not published yet. The full README (setup, API, deployment) comes with v0.1.

## Field values

Items are normalized: `fieldData` keys are camelCase, empty fields are absent, and Option fields are `{ id, name }`.

### Video links

A `VideoLink` field is an object:

```ts
post.fieldData.video?.url; // "https://vimeo.com/114900089"
post.fieldData.video?.metadata?.thumbnailUrl;
post.fieldData.video?.metadata?.aspectRatio; // width / height, computed by next-webflow
```

`metadata` is oEmbed data that Webflow fetches through Embedly. Every key is optional and varies by provider.

> **Security:** `metadata.html` is third-party iframe HTML from Embedly. next-webflow exposes it as data only and never renders it. If you render it (for example with `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`), you are trusting markup from Embedly and the video provider. Prefer building your own player from `url`.
